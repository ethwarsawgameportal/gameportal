# Wallet Implementation Status

## ✅ **Current Working State**

### **What's Working:**
1. **Civic Auth Integration**: ✅ Working
   - User authentication with Civic Auth
   - Profile display with user information
   - Identity verification status

2. **Profile Component**: ✅ Working
   - Shows user email, name, and verification status
   - Compact profile in header
   - Full profile on explore page

3. **Build & Deployment**: ✅ Working
   - Build passes successfully
   - App runs without errors
   - Ready for Vercel deployment

## ⚠️ **Wallet Functionality Status**

### **Current Issue:**
The Web3 wallet functionality is not fully implemented due to import conflicts between:
- `@civic/auth` (basic auth)
- `@civic/auth-web3` (Web3 wallet features)

### **What We Tried:**
1. ✅ Installed `@civic/auth-web3` package
2. ✅ Added `CivicAuthWeb3Provider` to layout
3. ✅ Added wallet hooks (`useWallet`, `useWeb3User`)
4. ❌ Encountered build/runtime errors with Web3 imports

### **Current Profile Shows:**
- ✅ User identity information
- ✅ Verification status
- ⚠️ Placeholder for wallet information
- ❌ No actual wallet address or balance

## 🎯 **Next Steps to Add Wallet Functionality**

### **Option 1: Separate Web3 Integration**
Create a separate wallet component that doesn't conflict with the basic auth:

```typescript
// Create a separate WalletInfo component
import { useWallet } from "@civic/auth-web3/react";
import { useBalance } from "wagmi";

export const WalletInfo = () => {
  const { address } = useWallet({ type: "ethereum" });
  const { data: balance } = useBalance({ address });
  
  if (!address) return <div>No wallet connected</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Address: {address}</p>
      <p>Balance: {balance?.formatted} {balance?.symbol}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Option 2: Use Coinbase OnchainKit Wallet**
Since you already have OnchainKit installed, use their wallet components:

```typescript
import { ConnectWallet, Address, EthBalance } from "@coinbase/onchainkit/wallet";

// In your Profile component
<ConnectWallet>
  <Address />
  <EthBalance />
</ConnectWallet>
```

### **Option 3: Manual Wallet Integration**
Use wagmi directly with a wallet connector:

```typescript
import { useAccount, useBalance } from "wagmi";

export const WalletInfo = () => {
  const { address, isConnected } = useAccount();
  const { data: balance } = useBalance({ address });
  
  if (!isConnected) return <div>Connect wallet to see balance</div>;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Address: {address}</p>
      <p>Balance: {balance?.formatted} {balance?.symbol}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 📋 **Recommended Approach**

**Use Option 2 (OnchainKit)** because:
- ✅ Already installed and working
- ✅ No import conflicts
- ✅ Professional UI components
- ✅ Easy to integrate
- ✅ Works with existing setup

## 🚀 **Current Status**

Your app is **fully functional** with:
- ✅ Civic Auth working
- ✅ Profile information displaying
- ✅ Build passing
- ✅ Ready for deployment

The wallet functionality can be added as a separate feature without breaking the existing auth system.

## 💡 **Quick Test**

Visit your app at `http://localhost:3000` and:
1. Sign in with Civic Auth
2. Check the header for your profile
3. Go to `/explore` to see the full profile
4. Verify everything is working

The wallet address display can be added as the next enhancement!
